# Development Contributing Guide

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account. (not needed if you are CUGA team)
2. Create a feature branch from `main` in your fork: `git checkout -b feature/<short-topic>` (see Branch Naming Convention below).
3. Keep PRs small and focused (prefer < ~300 changed lines and limited file count).
4. Follow Conventional Commits for all commits and PR titles.
5. Run formatting, linting, and tests locally before opening a PR.
6. Open a Pull Request from your fork to `main` with a clear description and checklist results.

Notes:
- All PRs are merged using "Squash and merge". The PR title will become the final commit message — write it carefully using the Conventional Commits format.
- Prefer one topic per PR. If your changes touch many areas, split into multiple PRs.

## DCO

This repository requires a Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 signoff on every commit. A DCO provides your assurance to the community that you wrote the code you are contributing or have the right to pass on the code that you are contributing. It is generally used in place of a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You can easily signoff a commit by using the -s or --signoff flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
```

If you are using the web interface, this should happen automatically. If you've already made a commit, you can fix it by amending the commit and force-pushing the change:

```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit --signoff
git push -f
```

This will only amend your most recent commit and will not affect the message. If there are multiple commits that need fixing, you can try:

```bash
git rebase --signoff HEAD~<n>
git push -f
```

where `<n>` is the number of commits missing signoffs.

## Commit Messages: Conventional Commits

We use the Conventional Commits specification. See the full spec at [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Structure:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`.

Good examples:

```
feat(api): add list-accounts endpoint to registry
fix(browser): prevent crash when page has no active frame
```

Breaking change example:

```
feat(api)!: switch account id field to string

BREAKING CHANGE: API consumers must treat account ids as strings.
```

Bad examples (do not use):

```
update stuff
wip: changes
fixes
typo
```

Why this matters:
- Enables clean history and automated tooling (changelogs, versioning).
- Because we squash-merge, the PR title becomes the final commit — use Conventional Commits in the PR title too.

## Branch Naming Convention

We follow the Conventional Branch specification. See the full spec at [conventional-branch.github.io](https://conventional-branch.github.io/).

### Branch Naming Structure

```
<type>/<description>
```

### Supported Branch Types

| Type         | Good Example                | Why It's Good                   | Bad Example                  | Why It's Bad                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Feature      | `feature/add-login-page`    | Lowercase, hyphens, descriptive | `Feature/AddLoginPage`       | Uppercase & no hyphens            |
| Fix          | `bugfix/header-bug`         | Clear, lowercase                | `feat/add_login`             | Uses underscore instead of hyphen |
| Hotfix       | `hotfix/security-patch`     | Clear, proper prefix            | `hotfix#security-patch`      | Contains invalid character `#`    |
| Release      | `release/v1.2.0`            | Correct dot usage for versions  | `release/v1..2.0`            | Consecutive dots                  |
| Chore        | `chore/update-dependencies` | Descriptive and valid           | `chore/update-dependencies-` | Trailing hyphen                   |
| Missing Desc | `feat/issue-123-new-login`  | Includes ticket, traceable      | `feature/`                   | Missing description               |

### Branch Naming Rules

1. **Use lowercase alphanumerics, hyphens, and dots**: Always use lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and hyphens(`-`) to separate words. Avoid special characters, underscores, or spaces. For release branches, dots (`.`) may be used in the description to represent version numbers (e.g., `release/v1.2.0`).
2. **No consecutive, leading, or trailing hyphens or dots**: Ensure that hyphens and dots do not appear consecutively, nor at the start or end of the description.
3. **Keep it clear and concise**: The branch name should be descriptive yet concise, clearly indicating the purpose of the work.
4. **Include ticket numbers**: If applicable, include the ticket number from your project management tool to make tracking easier.

Why this matters:
- **Clear Communication**: The branch name alone provides a clear understanding of its purpose.
- **Automation-Friendly**: Easily hooks into automation processes (e.g., different workflows for `feature`, `release`, etc.).
- **Team Collaboration**: Encourages collaboration by making branch purpose explicit.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep diffs small; avoid drive-by refactors. Separate formatting-only PRs from feature/fix PRs.
- Include a brief summary of what/why, and link related issues (e.g., `Refs: #123`).
- Add/update tests when changing behavior.
- Do not include generated files, large assets, secrets, or local config (e.g., `.env`).
- Ensure CI passes. If you see flaky tests, note it in the PR description.

### Pull Request Templates

We provide specific PR templates to help you create well-structured pull requests. When creating a PR, you can use one of these templates by adding the appropriate query parameter to the GitHub URL:

- **Feature PRs**: `?template=feature.md` - For new features and enhancements
- **Bug Fix PRs**: `?template=bugfix.md` - For bug fixes and issue resolutions
- **Documentation PRs**: `?template=docs.md` - For documentation updates and improvements
- **Chore PRs**: `?template=chore.md` - For maintenance tasks, dependency updates, and refactoring

Each template includes:
- Related issue linking
- Type of changes checkboxes
- Testing checklist
- Standard review checklist

GitHub will also automatically suggest these templates when you create a new pull request.

### Pre-PR Checklist (run locally)

Use `uv` for environment and tooling.

```
uv sync --dev
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix
# Run tests as described below
```

Must:
- If your change touches the browser/env, verify relevant demos still run.
- Update README.md or docs if only needed, discuss before

## Dependency lockfile (`uv.lock`)

Only the **repository root** `uv.lock` is committed. After changing dependencies in the root `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` from the repo root.

Examples under `docs/examples/cuga_as_mcp` and `docs/examples/cuga_with_runtime_tools` do **not** carry their own lockfiles: they resolve `cuga` from a path dependency and reuse the root lockfile’s resolution (including root-only `[tool.uv.dependency-metadata]`). Run commands from the example directory with `uv run --project ../../../ …` so `uv` uses the root project; see each example README.

## Security Scanning

Before committing, run security scanning to detect potential secrets:

```bash
uv pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/ibm/detect-secrets.git@master#egg=detect-secrets"
detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```

If everything passes, no need to mark secrets or false positives. This ensures no sensitive information is accidentally committed to the repository.

## Running Tests

### 1) Install dev dependencies

```bash
uv sync --dev
```


### Run tests

Lint and run the pytest suite:

```bash
uv run ruff check && uv run ruff format --check
uv run pytest -m "not stability and not pgvector and not manual and not e2e and not load" --load-test-users 5
uv run pytest src/system_tests/load/load_test_with_mocked_llm.py -m load --load-test-users 5
```

Other subsets:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not stability and not slow and not pgvector and not manual and not e2e and not load"   # fast local loop
uv run pytest -m stability --stability-threshold 88 -n0        # stability only
uv run pytest -m pgvector -o addopts="-ra --strict-markers --import-mode=importlib"
```

The default `uv run pytest` excludes `@pytest.mark.manual` and `@pytest.mark.pgvector` tests via `pyproject.toml` `addopts`.

> **Note:** CI's `unit-tests` job runs the suites above as several separate `pytest`
> invocations (grouped by area) rather than one big collection. A handful of suites
> rely on process-global singletons (the FastAPI `app` instance, the policy/config
> DB) that assume they're the only tests in the process; collecting everything into
> a single session can resurface cross-test state leaks unrelated to your change. If
> `uv run pytest` surfaces failures a single scoped run doesn't reproduce, try
> running just the affected file(s) in isolation before assuming a regression.


## AI Agent Commands

If you are working in an AI-assisted IDE or using an AI agent (Cursor, Claude, Bob), a set of pre-built workflow commands is available to streamline common contributor tasks. The same commands are mirrored across all three tooling directories:

| Location | For |
|---|---|
| `.cursor/commands/cuga-*.md` | Cursor agent |
| `.claude/commands/cuga-*.md` | Claude / claude-code |
| `.bob/commands/cuga-*.md` | Bob agent |

### Available Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cuga-commit` | Stages and commits changes using Conventional Commits with scoped messages and bullet-point descriptions |
| `cuga-create-pr` | Validates local state, picks the right PR template, fills it out from current changes, and opens the PR via `gh` |
| `cuga-report-bug` | Creates a GitHub issue using the `bug_report.yml` template with context from the current code |
| `cuga-new-feature` | Creates a GitHub issue using the `feature_request.yml` template |
| `cuga-ruff-check` | Runs `uv run ruff check --fix` and `uv run ruff format` on the project |

These commands follow all repo conventions (Conventional Commits, `gh` CLI, no promotional footers). To invoke them, use the slash-command syntax of your tool (e.g. `/cuga-commit` in Cursor).
