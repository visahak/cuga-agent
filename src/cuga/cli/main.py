    Cuga CLI: A management tool for Cuga services with direct execution.

    This tool helps you control various components of the Cuga ecosystem:

    - demo: Both registry and demo agent (runs directly)
    - demo_crm: CRM demo with email MCP, mail sink, and CRM API (runs directly)
    - demo_supervisor: Same as demo_crm but with CugaSupervisor multi-agent coordination
    - demo_health: Healthcare insurance demo (cuga-oak-health OpenAPI + manage UI)
    - registry: The MCP registry service only (runs directly)
    - appworld: AppWorld environment and API servers (runs directly)
    Examples:
      cuga start demo           # Start both registry and demo agent directly
      cuga start demo_crm       # Start CRM demo with all required services
      cuga start demo_supervisor # Start CRM demo with supervisor multi-agent mode
      cuga start registry       # Start registry only
      cuga start appworld       # Start AppWorld servers

    Demo MCP subprocesses and default workspace sample files are loaded from ``cuga.demo_tools``
    (on disk under ``site-packages/cuga/demo_tools`` when installed).

    Available services:
      - demo: Starts both registry and demo agent directly (registry on port 8001, demo on port 7860)
      - demo_crm: Starts CRM demo with email MCP, mail sink, and CRM API servers
      - demo_knowledge: Same as demo but with knowledge engine enabled (upload docs, RAG search). Use --reset to wipe knowledge data.
      - demo_supervisor: Same as demo_crm but with CugaSupervisor multi-agent coordination enabled
      - demo_docs: Starts registry + demo with only IBM Docs MCP (search, summarize, ask questions on pages)
      - demo_health: Starts cuga-oak-health OpenAPI, registry, and demo (insurance member APIs + OAK playbooks; add --filesystem for workspace MCP)
      - manager: Manage-config mode: registry uses managed MCP YAML, policy filesync off, demo on 7860
      - registry: Starts only the registry service directly (uvicorn on port 8001)
      - appworld: Starts AppWorld environment and API servers (environment on port 8000, api on port 9000)
    App flags (--crm, --email, --digital-sales, --docs, --filesystem) add apps to the preset:
      - demo: default = filesystem only (add --digital-sales for Digital Sales API)
